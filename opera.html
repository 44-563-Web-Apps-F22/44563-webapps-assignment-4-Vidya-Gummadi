   <h4>ACT I<br>SCENE - Pavilion attached to King Hildebrand's Palace.
    Soldiers and courtiers discovered looking out through opera-glasses, telescopes, etc., Florian leading.
    CHORUS AND SOLO (Florian) "Search throughout the panorama"<br></h4>
        Florian:     Will Prince Hilarion's hopes be sadly blighted?<br>
        Chorus:      Who can tell?  Who can tell?<br>                 
        Florian:     Will Ida break the vows that she has plighted?<br>                 
        Chorus:      Who can tell?  Who can tell?<br>                
        Florian:     Will she back out, and say she did not mean them?<br>                 
        Chorus:      Who can tell?<br>                 
        Florian:     If so, there'll be the deuce to pay between them!<br>
        Chorus:           No, no — we'll not despair, we'll not despair,
                    For Gama would not dare
                    To make a deadly foe
                    Of Hildebrand, and so,
                          Search through the panorama
                          For a sign of royal Gama,
                          Who today should cross the water
                          With his fascinating daughter—
                          Ida, Ida is her name.(Enter King Hildebrand with Cyril)
