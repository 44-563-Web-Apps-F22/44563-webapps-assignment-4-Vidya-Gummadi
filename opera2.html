    <p class="song"> No, no — we'll not despair, we'll not despair,
        For Gama would not dare<br>
        To make a deadly foe<br>
        Of Hildebrand, and so,<br>
        Search through the panorama<br>
        For a sign of royal Gama,<br>
        Who today should cross the water<br>
        With his fascinating daughter—<br>
        Ida, Ida is her name.
